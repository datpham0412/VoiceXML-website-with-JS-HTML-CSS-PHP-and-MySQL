      <li><strong>Shadow and zebra striped for table: </strong> For this assignment, I made a table which has shadow for the border and make the background of the table looks like a zebra striped (1 line Black interleaved with 1 line White). The pseudo-code "n-th child" was used in my assignment</li>
      <li><strong>Making fluid pages flow (relative dimensions): </strong> The code was written in the responsive.css file. In order to mix in nicely with the screen-size, I modified the size and location of several components of the pages, such as the navigation bar, sidebar, photos, footer, and so on.</li>
